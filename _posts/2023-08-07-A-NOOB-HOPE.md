<p>On what presumably was to be an entirely uneventful day, I was blissfully unaware that I'd be making a fateful decision that would impact me for the next two decades and beyond...</p>
<h3>EndGame</h3>
<p>Wikipedia describes GameStop as:</p>
<blockquote>
  GameStop Corp. is an American video game, consumer electronics, and gaming merchandise retailer. The company is headquartered in Grapevine, Texas (a suburb of Dallas), and is the largest video game retailer worldwide. As of 28 January 2023, the company operates 4,413 stores including 2,949 in the United States, 216 in Canada, 419 in Australia and 829 in Europe under the GameStop, EB Games, EB Games Australia, Micromania-Zing, ThinkGeek and Zing Pop Culture brands. The company was founded in Dallas in 1984 as Babbage's, and took on its current name in 1999.

<p>But it is so much more.</p>
<p>The circumstances which lead me to be employed at the local GameStop were surely benign. My expectations were nothing more than making a few dollars and connecting with some fellow gamers. Though I did find myself hocking a subpar gaming "publication" and serving as a glorified librarian at the close of store hours, the unexpected joy I would soon discover in MMORPG games would overshadow any of the potential drawbacks.</p>
